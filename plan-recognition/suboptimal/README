1. SOME NOTES ON BUILDING & PDDL SUPPORT
=============================================================

C^3 sources have been written in C++ compliant with g++ 4.1.3. The 
planner just won't compile under g++ 3.x or g++ 4.0 due to some
changes made to the usage of the 'typename' keyword and handling
of inline friend functions (at the very least). We earnestly recommend
to upgrade your system with g++ 4.1.3 rather than modifying C^3 sources.

C^3 uses Metric-FF distribution (with some slight tweaking) for 
parsing and grounding the problem specification in PDDL. Therefore
C^3 supports all of PDDL features *bar conditional effects*. C^3
behavior on problem specifications featuring CE will be pretty random.

The modified sources for Metric-FF can be found in folder
	./mod-metric-ff
The PDDL parser can be built, out-of-the box, with bison 2.3 and
flex 2.5.33.

We would like to thank JÃ¶rg Hoffmann for making available Metric-FF
sources, and Malte Helmert for making available the Python script
benchmark.py.
